Section2 Building a spring Bott We App

SOLUTION
============
I solved the ussiew below by removing the spaces and ";" from my directory
in which I store my project.
It seems that the IDE's (both IntelliJ and Eclpse) don't seem to be able
to find the path to the main application if they are in such folders.
This was not an issue using javac command as I was running from inside
thge project folder using relative paths.
>java -jar ./target/spring5webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Whe I chcked the path in IntelliJ -> edit run configuration, I realized it uses the
absolute path to find the main method 
/home/joao/Courses/UdemyCourses/SpringFramework5_Beginner_to_Guru/Projects/IntelliJ/sfg-di

As You can See I added underscores instead of spaces and removed the ":".
Not sure if colon was an issue....

Issues

1. Unable to run the app from the IDE
   workaround

   I run from the terminal by skipping the tests and
   packaging to a fat jar.
   then I start app using java -jar

>mvn package -DskipTests
>java -jar ./target/spring5webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

2. To activate the H2 console on the web

   add these lines to application.properties
   spring.h2.console.enabled=true -> so it will open in browser (default is false)
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb -> give your db a name
   and then run as above in point one

   open conmsole in browser with http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
   make sure that the databse in console login screen in browser has same database name
