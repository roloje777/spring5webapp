Section2 Building a spring Bott We App

Issues

1. Unable to run the app from the IDE
   workaround

   I run from the terminal by skipping the tests and
   packaging to a fat jar.
   then I start app using java -jar

>mvn package -DskipTests
>java -jar ./target/spring5webapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

2. To activate the H2 console on the web

   add these lines to application.properties
   spring.h2.console.enabled=true -> so it will open in browser (default is false)
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb -> give your db a name
   and then run as above in point one

   open conmsole in browser with http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
   make sure that the databse in console login screen in browser has same database name
